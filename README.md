# Intro to Web Scraping

This folder contains a [presentation](WebScraping.pptx) I gave to my wider team at work covering the basics of web-scraping.

As part of this, I provided the following worked examples.

* Extract basic stats for PokemonGo creatures. ([Excel VBA version](Pokemon%20Stats%20Extractor/Extractor.xlsb)) ([R version](Pokemon%20Stats%20Extractor/Pokemon%20Stats%20Extractor.Rproj))
* Obtain list of cocktails from the [online cocktail database](https://www.thecocktaildb.com) whose names start with a given letter. ([Excel VBA version](Cocktail%20Extractor/BoozeExtractor.xlsb)) ([R version](Cocktail%20Extractor/Cocktail%20Extractor.Rproj))

This was the first time I have placed such a project on GitHub and also the first time using R markdown (`Rmd`) files to generate teaching content.

Hopefully this is of some use to whoever reads this!
